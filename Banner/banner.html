          Vegetables are essential components of a healthy diet, providing a
          rich source of vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and antioxidants.
          Botanically, they are edible parts of plants such as leaves (spinach),
          roots (carrots), stems (asparagus), and even some fruits that are
          culinarily used as vegetables (tomatoes). Regular consumption of a
          variety of colorful vegetables is linked to a reduced risk of chronic
          diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and certain types of
          cancer. To maximize health benefits, experts often recommend eating at
          least five servings of different-colored produce daily. Whether eaten
          raw to preserve water-soluble vitamins or cooked to enhance the
          absorption of nutrients like lycopene in tomatoes, vegetables play a
          vital role in supporting digestion, boosting immunity, and maintaining
          a healthy weight
